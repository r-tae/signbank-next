# Creating your localisation JSONs

Most of the IDs are autogenerated (to prevent ID collisions), but some features require messages to be selected at runtime based on data or user actions. These IDs are namespaced and will have to be added manually, but care must be taken to add all possible IDs to avoid a poor UX.

## Region map

<!-- TODO: redo this for the new i18n library -->

The map on the dictionary entry page (`pages/dictionary/[id_gloss].tsx`) highlights geographic regions using the `dictionary[0].language.region` property from the database. Since the specific values depend on the language/SVG, the `<locale>.json` should have one message for each possible region ID in the form:
human-readable-region-name\_\_[region ID]

For example, the Auslan Signbank's `en.json` includes:

```json
{
  "human-readable-region-name__AUS": "Australia-wide",
  "human-readable-region-name__NTH": "Northern Dialect",
  "human-readable-region-name__STH": "Southern Dialect",
  "human-readable-region-name__VIC": "Victoria",
  "human-readable-region-name__QLD": "Queensland",
  "human-readable-region-name__TAS": "Tasmania",
  "human-readable-region-name__SA": "South Australia",
  "human-readable-region-name__NT": "Northern Territory",
  "human-readable-region-name__WA": "Western Australia",
  "human-readable-region-name__NSW": "New South Wales"
  [...]
}
```

the matching CSS for highlighting based on these region IDs can be found in `docs/region-map.md`.
