# Signbank Next API

The Signbank Next API is written in Go.

Things to store in the database, that I was going to put in config:
- map SVG (maybe?)
- phonology fields ({ title: "Initial dominant hand shape", id: "initialDominantHandShape", values: ["Ball", "Flat", ""] }) (not sure if `title` is necessary)
- phonological sort function/s
- Languages (probably should just put in as many as I can one day in like august, there aren't *that* many SLs)
-
